# Overview
This is a repository to share dependency-based Japanese word embeddings which we trained for experiments in the article [係り受けに基づく日本語単語埋込 (Dependency-based Japanese Word Embeddings)](https://ai-lab.lapras.com/nlp/japanese-word-embedding/).

We applied the method proposed in the paper [Dependency-based Word Embeddings](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-2050) to Japanese.  

# Training Details

To prepare the training data, we first extracted sentences from [Japanese Wikipedia dumps](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/jawiki/).  
Then, we parsed them using an NLP framework [GiNZA](https://github.com/megagonlabs/ginza).  
Finally, we trained the embeddings with the script provided in [the page of the paper's first author](https://levyomer.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/dependency-based-word-embeddings/).  

The parameter settings for the experiments is as below where DIM is the number of dimensions written in each file name.
```
-size DIM -negative 15 -threads 20
```

# How to Use the Embeddings
You can use the embeddings in the same way as embeddings trained by using the original implementation of [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/).

Here is an example code to load them from your Python script.

```
from gensim.models import KeyedVectors
vectors = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format("path/to/embeddings")
```
